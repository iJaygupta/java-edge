<h3>Information Security and Data Protection</h3>
<p>
    In order to insure information security and data protection we have come with the following policy,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Network Protection –</b> we have implemented network protection controls (i.e AWS VPC, AWS Web Application Firewall, Server and Database Access Restrict under the VPC etc) to deny access to unauthorized IP addresses, SQL Injection, Brute Force, DoS Protection and to restrict public access only to approved users.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Access Management –</b> we assign a unique ID to each person with computer access to our product and services. We do not create or use generic, shared, or default login credentials or user accounts. We create user account based on provided information where password and secure pin is sent on registered mobile number and email id. The password & pin is generated automatically and encrypted in database. To login, user need both password and pin.
    </li>
    <p>
        We have implemented baselining mechanisms to ensure that at all times only the required user accounts access Marketplace information. We restrict our employees from storing marketplace data on personal devices. We review on a regular basis (at least quarterly) the list of people and services with access to Marketplace Information, and remove accounts that no longer require access.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further we maintain and enforce "account lockout" by detecting anomalous usage patterns and log-in attempts, and disabling accounts as needed. We also block user account based on multiple wrong attempts for login to protect system from brute force and send email alert on registered mail id. 
    </p>
    <li>
        <b>Login Alert –</b> For every successful login and multiple wrong attempt we collect the system data including user's ip address, operating system and browser data. We also send an email alert on registered mail id for every successful login.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Encryption in Transit –</b> We encrypt all Marketplace Information as well as user information in transit. We are also using HTTPS connection which encrypt data by default.  We enforce this security control on all applicable external endpoints used by customers as well as internal communication channels and operational tooling.
    </li>
    <p>
        We use data message-level encryption where channel encryption terminates in untrusted multi-tenant hardware.
    </p>
    <li>
        <b>Incident Response Plan –</b> We have implemented appropriate systems and controls to detect and handle Security Incidents. We also review and verify Incident response plan every six (6) months and after any major infrastructure or system change. Further the plan includes investigation of each Security Incident, and documents the incident description, remediation actions, and associated corrective process/system controls implemented to prevent future recurrence. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Request for Deletion or Return –</b> On the request from Marketplace we are committed to permanently, and securely delete  or return Marketplace Information as per marketplace policy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Data Retention and Recovery -</b> We make database backup and snapshot  regularly in private cloud storage for data loss protection and we may retain archival copies of PII and other required data for tax or similar regulatory purposes if required by law, this archived Information is stored as a "cold" or offline (e.g., not available for immediate or interactive use) backup stored in a physically secure facility. All archived data stored on backup media is encrypted. In the event that PII is lost, we have implemented required system to recover all PII lost.
    </li>
    <p>
        All archived data stored on backup media is encrypted. In the event that PII is lost, we have implemented required system to recover all PII lost.
    </p>
    <li>
        <b>Data Governance –</b> We are committed to implement adequate governance system. The  governance includes but not limited to, 1) keeping inventory of software and physical assets (e.g. computers, mobile devices) with access to PII, and updating it regularly and 2) Maintaining A record of data processing activities such as specific data fields and how they are collected, processed, stored, used, shared, and disposed for all PII Information in order to establish accountability and compliance with regulations. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Encryption and Storage –</b>we encrypt all PII and other important information at rest using industry best practice standards. We have implemented adequate controls for accessibility of the cryptographic materials and cryptographic capabilities used for encryption of PII at rest. That material and capabilities are accessible only to our services and processes. We do not store PII and other important information in removable media or unsecured public cloud applications. Further adequate controls are there to dispose of any printed documents containing PII.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Least Privilege Principle -</b> We have implemented fine-grained access control mechanisms to allow granting rights to any party using the Application. We provide admin and employee panels as per the usage/subscription basis. We authenticate user role and token for every single transaction. Application sections or features that vend PII are protected under a unique access role, and such access is granted on a "need-to-know" basis. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Logging and Monitoring -</b> We have implemented logging mechanism to detect security related events. We use CloudWatch to generate server, storage and database logs. We also use internal logs system to collect logs for important changes in application by user.  All logs have access controls to prevent any unauthorized access and tampering throughout their lifecycle. Logs themselves do not contain PII and are retained for at least 90 days for reference in the case of a Security Incident. We have built a mechanism to monitor the logs and all system activities to trigger investigative alarms on suspicious actions. 
    </li>
</ul>
